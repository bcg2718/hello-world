I must not fear.

Fear is the mind-killer.

Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

I will face my fear.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

Only I will remain.

Logical fallacies:

Agrument from consequences: p is not true because you value q, p is not false because you fear q.

Straw man: attacking the argument's ugly cousin says nothing about the orignal argument.
